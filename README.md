This is the learning (SCI, scalable computation intelligence) group at Texas Advanced Computing Center.
We support most of the deep learning applications across TACC platforms including [Frontera](https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guide/), [Lonestar6](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/lonestar6), and [Longhorn](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/longhorn).
We have wide research interests in deep learning and high performance computing. 
Our research foci include:
- Scalable Neural Network Optimization
- Scientific Deep Learning Applications
- Cyberinfrastructure for Deep Learning on Supercomputers

During the past years, we have successfully facilitated a diverse set of scientific deep learning applications.
Exemplar applications include:
- [OpenFold, to be updated]()
- [Electron Microscopy Image Super-resolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01080-z)

We also maintained a few deep learning applications with [the distributed K-FAC optimizer](https://github.com/gpauloski/kfac-pytorch) for the numerical optimization community to empirically evaluate convergence:
- [ResNet-50](https://github.com/gpauloski/kfac-pytorch/blob/main/examples/torch_imagenet_resnet.py)
- [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/gpauloski/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/Segmentation/MaskRCNN)
- [BERT](https://github.com/gpauloski/BERT-PyTorch)
